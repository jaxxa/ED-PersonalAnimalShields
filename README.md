# ED-PersonalAnimalShields
This is the Readme for the Enhanced Devemopment Mod, ED-PersonalAnimalShields, for the Game Rimworld.

This Requires ED-PersonalNanoShields inorder to function as all of the logic is contained in that mod.

All this mod does is change the thingClass on the aninmals so that they are able to have shields enabled.


This is done with setting:

<thingClass>Enhanced_Development.PersonalShields.Animal.ShieldPawn</thingClass>

To Update to a new version it will be easier to copy over the base animal objects and the just replace the thingclass in base.
Remove HumanLike and Mechanoid
